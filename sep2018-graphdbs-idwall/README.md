# Graph Databases
*IDwall Tech Talk*

**When:** 2018-09-06

**Where:** IDwall Tech Office. SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

I started talking a little bit about graphs in general, mentioning the powerful theory behind them and why graphs are awesome. The next topic was on graph databases and their common usage. Lastly, I talked about neo4j, showing its desktop app interface and the Cypher language, trying some queries.
